OH MY GOSH

I have been so wrong! Guess what, I thought that I will just look through some courses, watch some videos, learn some math a bit and that is it.
Thanks to that video that made me know I was wrong! 
Now I understand that even going through the math will be an incredibly difficult journey.
I can not imagine how long will it take me just to go through the first book.
And I am not even talking about full comprehension.
MATHMATHMATHMATHMATHMATHMATHMAAAAAAAATH.
but thank god i have woken up.
Even though i had some doubts about my progress I didn't really care about anything.
I spent the whole day doing nothing and nothing-everything.
I thought that my job now was only a matter of time.
"Why do they have to get masters in mathematics for this? It is so easy!" - I thought
Happy I am now, happy and full of desperation as I understand a bit what it really is.
So, I have only about 840 days for that shit. I am not really sure it will be able to get through this.
But, now I have a challenge.
Fight!
