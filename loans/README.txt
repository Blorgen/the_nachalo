Well, this is a project for education. Only 614 rows~, 
but it didn't matter, 
because my goal was to gain skills working with data and models.
That was a pain in the ass. I got errors here and there,
and then all my work turned out to be a piece of garbage.
I had to search for a tutorial. But as I didn't want to just copy 
the tutorial, I just took the steps I forgot or even
didn't know about. I learned about uni- and bi-variate analysis.
How to standartize the data, even though I still have got a lot to learn.
Made a list of steps that are necessary. For example, I didn't make 
hypothesis about data, I didn't think of it. I just started working 
with it right away. Now I know that's not a great idea. 
Well, know I understand the whole process a little bit better and 
understand what a long way I have got to go.
